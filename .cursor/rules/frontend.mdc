## Component Creation
- When asking for new React components, specify if they should follow Shadcn UI patterns
- Include Tailwind CSS classes by default
- Components should be created with proper TypeScript types
- Follow the project's existing component structure (`components/ui/` or `components/shared/`)
- never use calendar shadcn component


## Code Style
- Use React 19 features and patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Include proper prop validation
- Follow the project's existing context patterns
- Use the established folder structure
- Use React Query
- Use the the corrects api routes

## State Management
- Prefer React context for global state
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Implement proper loading and error states
