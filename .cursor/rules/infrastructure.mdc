# Infrastructure Rules

> **Rules for working with Docker and infrastructure components**

## Critical Rules

### Use Docker exclusively
- **Severity: CRITICAL**
- Always use Docker for development, never run commands directly on the host
- Never execute `npm install` directly; all dependencies are managed in containers
- Use the Docker Compose configuration in the `infra` folder

### Never modify package.json
- **Severity: CRITICAL**
- Never modify package.json in the frontend directory
- All dependency management should happen through Docker
- If new dependencies are required, discuss with the team first

### Preserve volume configurations
- **Severity: CRITICAL**
- Do not modify volume configurations in docker-compose.yml
- The project uses specific volume mappings:
  - `frontend_node_modules:/app/node_modules`
  - `backend_vendor:/var/www/symfony/vendor`
  - `backend_var:/var/www/symfony/var`
  - `jwt_keys:/var/www/symfony/config/jwt`

## High Priority Rules

### Respect service dependencies
- **Severity: HIGH**
- Respect the dependencies between services defined in docker-compose.yml
- The dependency chain is: frontend → backend → database/redis
- Wait for dependent services to be ready before attempting operations

## Medium Priority Rules

### Container shell access
- **Severity: MEDIUM**
- Use `docker-compose exec [service] bash` or `docker-compose exec [service] sh` to access container shells
- Example: `docker-compose exec backend bash` for PHP container shell

### Database interactions
- **Severity: MEDIUM**
- Database credentials are defined in docker-compose.yml
- Database data is persisted in Docker volumes
