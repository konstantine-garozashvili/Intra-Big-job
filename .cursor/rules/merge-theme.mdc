I'm currently merging my repository, which is the project's global repository, with work from a repository belonging to one of the developer groups.

Here's what remains to be fixed:

- Ugly loading effect when switching from one page to another on public pages. I'd like it to be completely invisible.
- Colors set up with tailwind don't appear on the page; the text remains white.
- Navbar doesn't appear because the main layout isn't used in App.jsx.
