# Mutagen Test Report

## Overview

This document contains the results of testing the Mutagen integration with the Intra-Big-Job project.

## Test Environment

- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Docker Version**: Docker Compose version v2.33.1-desktop.1
- **Project**: Intra-Big-Job

## Test Results

### Installation Status

- **Mutagen Installation**: Failed
- **Installation Method Attempted**: 
  - Chocolatey package manager (`choco install mutagen`)
  - Direct download from GitHub releases
  - Windows MSI installer

### Configuration Verification

- **Configuration Files**: 
  - `mutagen.yml` - Present and correctly configured
  - `docker-compose.mutagen.yml` - Present and correctly configured
  - Start/stop scripts - Present and correctly configured

### Functionality Testing

- **Docker Containers**: Running correctly without Mutagen
- **Mutagen Synchronization**: Not tested due to installation issues

## Issues Encountered

1. **Mutagen Installation Failure**:
   - The Chocolatey package for Mutagen was not found in the repository
   - Direct download attempts from GitHub failed due to connection issues
   - The Mutagen website URLs have changed (possibly due to Docker acquisition)

2. **Container Naming**:
   - The Docker containers are running with names that don't match the expected names in the Mutagen configuration
   - Current container names use the format `infra-frontend-1` instead of `intra-big-job-frontend-1` as specified in the Mutagen configuration

## Recommendations

1. **Update Mutagen Installation Instructions**:
   - The documentation should be updated with the latest installation methods
   - Consider providing a direct download link to a verified Mutagen installer

2. **Update Container Names in Configuration**:
   - Modify the `mutagen.yml` file to match the actual container names being used
   - Example change:
     ```yaml
     frontend:
       alpha: "./frontend"
       beta: "docker://infra-frontend-1:/app"
     ```

3. **Alternative Approach**:
   - If Mutagen installation continues to be problematic, consider using Docker Desktop's WSL2 backend on Windows which provides better performance without requiring Mutagen

## Conclusion

The Mutagen integration is well-configured in the project, but installation issues prevented full testing. The Docker containers are running correctly without Mutagen, so the project is functional, but may not have optimal file synchronization performance on Windows systems.

Once Mutagen is successfully installed, testing should be conducted to verify synchronization performance improvements.
